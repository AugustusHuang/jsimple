A hobby ECMA-script 6 interpreter written in Common Lisp, still in its infancy!

## Target
The most recent version of ECMA-262 standard shows more possibilities to regard ECMA-script (or javascript)
as a general functional language, so it becomes more natural to implement a es/js interpreter in functional
languages. With the help of functional IR and optimization, I hope es/js code will run fast on a great
Common Lisp environment such as SBCL. In addition, sometimes it's really annoying to test a es/js module
in a browser, maybe simulating will be interesting? Or make a standalone executable?
